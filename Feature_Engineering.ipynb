It helps in machine learning by ensuring that all features contribute equally to the model, improving the speed of convergence for optimization algorithms, and enhancing the performance of distance-based algorithms. Common methods include Min-Max Scaling (scaling features to a range of [0, 1]) and Standardization (transforming features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1)."
